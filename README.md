## ðŸš€ How to run

1. **Copy the `.env` file**:

```bash
cp ./frontend/.env.example ./frontend/.env
```

NOTE: The backend ".env" is not needed (it's already defined in the root ".env")

NOTE: To use the suggestions feature you need a gemini api key `.env` (in root)

2. **Deploy the project**:

```bash
make deploy
```

That's it!
